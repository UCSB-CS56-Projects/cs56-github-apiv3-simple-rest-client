cs56-games-battleship, NO , mastergberry , OliverHKU  , Battleship game (Discontinued) , 23 , Potential Risk of the Newly Added Ship Size Customization Feature , OliverHKU , closed , I suddenly found a bug in the recently added feature (let user input 5 integers). It turned out that if the user inputs a string other than integer (say he inputs "three" somehow). the program will report an error and the reminder message won't appear. I'm now trying to fix the bug.  @andrewberls   ~estimated 50
cs56-games-battleship, NO , mastergberry , OliverHKU  , Battleship game (Discontinued) , 22 , Adding Hit Count , OliverHKU , closed , Since the new feature (ship size customization) is already added. if the player chooses 5 big integers as their ship size. it would be hard for them to remember how many squares they've already hit all the time. It's time to add a hit count feature to record the number of squares already be hit.  @andrewberls     ~estimated 200

cs56-games-battleship, NO , mastergberry , OliverHKU  , Battleship game (Discontinued) , 18 , Allow the user to decide ship sizes in GUI , pconrad , closed , OliverHKU , Up to now. the ship sizes are still fixed (say {2.3.3.4.5}).     Add a feature to allow the user to decide what sizes of ships he / she wants.    This will be achieved by adding a new frame if the player selects the "play against the computer" mode. and letting the player key in 5 integers not exceeding 10. then setting the ship sizes according to the input.    ~estimated 300    (100 for just adding the user interface elements---200 for making them actually work.  I suggest that you attack in two phases---add the user interface element FIRST. with a label that says "THIS FEATURE NOT IMPLEMENTED YET") but get that working.  That is. the program will accept the input. and validate that the input is valid. but it will NOT actually change the hard coded sizes of battleships.       Then. change the code so that the feature works. and remove the warning label.
cs56-games-battleship, NO , mastergberry , OliverHKU  , Battleship game (Discontinued) , 17 , Issue: Objectify , kreimer314 , closed , OliverHKU , The resolution of a previous issue has greatly reduced the complexity of this code and compacted it. However. it has been left in a disorganized and highly 'clumped' state. There are many opportunities to clean up this code. move features to methods. and most importantly. modulate components in accordance to object oriented programming philosophies.    Consider:  - Looking for repeated code that can be made into a method  - Making an external object of the GUI's inner class Board  - Making the controller better by having the majority of its functions methodized  - Renaming variables and parameters to achieve consistency and ease of understanding  - Adding comments and Javadoc comments where they are lacking    ~estimated: 300 points

I went the extra mile to have a 'floating' ship follow the cursor while the player is placing ships.    ~requested 300    Note: I am very pressed for time right now and this new code is not clean or well documented. I apologize for that and I feel very sorry for the next person that chooses to work on it.

cs56-games-battleship, NO , mastergberry , OliverHKU  , Battleship game (Discontinued) , 3 , Make yet another GUI , pconrad , closed , kreimer314 , So. @twodimension and @kreimer314  you may BOTH work on this.   We are going to create two separate issues. and and assign one to each of you.    In the end. we may end creating separate "branches" in the origin repo. one for each of your versions. and then deciding which one to keep.    Please try to use a good MVC (Model-View-Controller) separation between your model class and your GUI.     Ask a moderator to help you understand what this design pattern means.   The basic idea is that you want to keep the "model" of Battleship independent of the "user interface"---so the classes that make the game work "don't know. and don't care" whether the user is using a command line interface. or a GUI interface.  You are not CHANGING the interface from command line to GUI. you are ADDING a GUI interface. but RETAINING the command line interface. and keeping the parts of the game that are common to both as separate as possible from the details of the user interaction.

cs56-games-blackjack, W15-YES , mliou , JaredBJensen (4pm) , (jstaahl) Blackjack game , 12 , Issues #8 and #9... Moderator: andrewberls , ericpalyan , closed , Issues that needed resolving before moving on:  *Cleaning up the code and adding comments*  There was very little comments and the code was in big chunks. Made it difficult to understand what was being done. Had to go through and add comments. format it better. move some things around for efficiency. etc.  ~request 100    *Cleaning up/Enhancing the GUI*  The window frames would pop up off screen and the widgets were not aligned. Fixed those and also formatted the player panels to make them "layered" instead of all the text being on one line (the JLabels that display player information).   ~request 100    Main Issues  *Issue #8 - Currency*  Had to work around a few things and figure out how the code was executing and in what order. I also had to make multiple methods to keep track of changes as well as keep the labels updated etc. It took some time to implement so I did not have time to allow the user to change the bet value after each hand but that can be easily added the next time.  ~request: 200    *Issue #9 - Double Down*  It only allows the player to double down at the beginning of their hand. Once they hit the option disables/"goes away". Doubling down deducts the bet amount from the player's money on hand and draws one card. After that the player can't hit. it goes on to the next player at the table (or the dealer).  ~request: 150    Other Issues/Enhancements  *Rules Frame*  Added a rules window explaining how the game is played along with winning/losing conditions. etc for those who are not familiar with blackjack or need a reminder.  ~request: 75    *5 Card Charlie*  This is another rule in blackjack (or in a form of one). Having 5 cards without busting is another condition to win. Blackjack(21) > 5 card charlie.  ~request: 75      ------------------------------------  ~request total: 700  ------------------------------------

(See the lab about TicTacToe for an example).  * Then. there should be a simple command line interface to show that the game works.

You will find that certain existing classes lend themselves well to Views while others seem to do the work of both a Controller and a View at the same time. Separate these classes into separate View and Controller entities.    You can also remove classes if you do not see them fitting as either a Model or a View or a Controller.    As a start:  Try breaking MazeComponent up into a view and a controller.  The controller should have a MazeGrid among other things. A MazeGrid lends itself well to a Model. as does a MazePlayer. A MazeGrid should have a MazePlayer (but a MazePlayer should not have a MazeGrid).  These are just some suggestions to get you started. You will most likely find many other instances of classes that should be broken up or absorbed into Models. Views. and/or Controllers.    ~estimated 400

However. if you save this maze then reopen it. you will find the other parts of the maze that you had previously revealed are hidden again.   Fix this issue by making sure that the markers in the grid used by progressive reveal are saved and loaded to and from the save file.    Also. you will notice that if you turn on Progressive Reveal. then start a new maze and save it. then turn off Progressive Reveal and load that maze. if you press "new" this new maze will be loaded as if Progressive Reveal is still on (although the menu claims it is turned off).  It may be the case that the check mark next to Progressive Reveal in the Menu only gets toggled with a click of the Menu item itself. although Progressive Reveal may still be activated (or inactivated) internally.

But if you do that. the maze cannot be solved.    Is this because the code that generates the maze doesn't respect these settings. and is assuming hard coded values of the default initial settings?    Or is the code that generates the maze assuming a square maze?    Or is it some other problem?    The best solution is one that keeps the maximum flexibility in the settings while still making sure the maze is always solvable.    A bad solution is one that just takes away the ablity to change the settings.    Only a good solution is acceptable.    Having said that. if there settings that don't make sense---i.e. are incompatible with logic. make a case for why they should be removed.  If your case it good. we can remove those settings.  DON'T remove the cellWidth setting however---that one is needed for a later issue!

The blue dot indicating the user and the red goal square should scale at the same rate.    In this mode. the minimum window size should be one where the cellWidth is 8.

Adjust the size of this window to be reasonable. and put the scroll bar in a reasonable starting place.    Also the HowTo button should perhaps be labelled Help ?    (2) As soon as the GUI comes up. the game starts before a new user can even see what is going on.    Instead. have the GUI come up without a maze. and have a label at the bottom that says    Maze game: click help for instructions.    (3) The WASD keys are used.    Add code so that the arrow keys ALSO work. identically to the WASD keys. and make the instructions reflect this.    (4) While a game is in progress. it doesn't make much sense to change the menu options.  See if you can disable the menu while a game is in progress. and either grey it out. or hide it completely.  Have it only appear when the maze is solved by the user. or when the solve button is clicked. (i.e. when the clock is stopped.)

Uses PDFBox as a tool. , 9 , substrings matches vs. exact keyword matches , kjorg50 , open , For both of the utilities in this project. think about what happens if you search for a string such as `car`. but then the results that you get aren't actually matches for `car`; instead. the results you got were the following    * a match of the word `carbohydrates` in one file  *  `carpet` in another file  * `incarceration` in a third file.     You actually were interested for text related to cars. but what you got was very different. Does the current implementation return successful matches if the search text is a substring of the actual text? If not. consider making both cases an option. because sometimes a substring does indicate a relevant search. Maybe I searched for the string `ball` and I got keyword search matches that were for `football`. `baseball`. and `handball`. In this scenario these matches might be relevant.    To summarize. you will want to do the following  1. explore how substring matches work in the current implementation  2. create the ability to search for exact keyword matches  3. create the ability to search for non-exact keyword matches (i.e. substrings)    ~estimated 300

For example:    ```  Arduino  Scratch  ```    pdf-dir is the name of a directory that contains multiple PDF files. e.g. mypdfdir    ```  dhcp-41-215:foobar pconrad$ ls  mypdfdir  dhcp-41-215:foobar pconrad$ ls mypdfdir/  paper1.pdf	paper2.pdf	paper3.pdf  dhcp-41-215:foobar pconrad$   ```    The output should be list of comma separated values where each line indicates that a keyword appears in a particular paper.  For example:    paper1.pdf.Arduino  paper1.pdf.Scratch  paper2.pdf.Scratch  paper3.pdf.Scratch  paper3.pdf.Arduino    It is not necessary for the lines to appear in any particular order---assume that if they need to be sorted in some way. some other piece of software will handle that (e.g. they might be imported into a spreadsheet).  However. there should be no duplicates---output only one line per filename/keyword pair.

This is an opportunity for you to get creative here.  Have you ever thought that Gold's course search or even "Advanced" course search was highly limited and wanted to make more specific searches on courses?  Prompt the user for the search criteria you deem important and print the resulting courses.

For example if I couldn't remember a player's full first and last name. but I remembered that his first name began with "Han" and his last name began with "Ram". I could search "Han Ram" and be presented with the player "Hanley Ramirez". Or. if I forgot how to spell his name and typed "Hanly Ramirez" I should still be presented with the result for "Hanley Ramirez".     There should be some [Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/) library functions available to help achieve this.    Estimated 250 pts
cs56-scrapers-baseball-stats, ? , jstaahl 5pm , maxsorenson , (kjorg50) a scraper that gathers statistics on Major League Baseball players , 9 , Search functionality , kjorg50 , open , maxsorenson , Add the appropriate Java Swing elements to create a "search box" where you can enter the name of a player for which you would like to view statistics. This would be used to filter the data. For example. typing "Tony Gwynn" would result in just the one row of statistics for that player. Alternatively. typing "Gonzalez" should result in the statistics for any player with "Gonzalez" in his name. This means that the search should look at both first and last names. If there are no results found for a given search. then display an appropriate message to the user.     The [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) library may be helpful for this. [Here is a simple tutorial](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/4_0_0/tutorial.html).

Create a way of viewing an "Advanced Statistics" window. which will contain a similar table layout. but will display statistics for associated splits. It makes the most sense to organize a table of splits by player. So. design a way to select one player. and then display his respective splits. This is an example layout    | Split | Statistic_1 | Statistic_2 | Statistic_3 |  |-------|---------------|-----------|--------------|  |  "name of split"  |  aaa | bbb | ccc |    For more examples. look at the layout of split statistics [for players on fangraphs.com](http://www.fangraphs.com/statsplits.aspx?playerid=8001&position=SS&season=2013)    Estimated 600 pts

The exact user interaction which will cause the opening of the new window is left up to the developer.     One option might be to double click on a player's name to cause the opening of a new window. Another option might be to add additional buttons next to the table. and when a player's name is selected. the user can click a button to "Show Player Stats" which causes the opening of the new window.

For example. if you click on the column labeled as HR. then all of the players in the table will be sorted by highest to lowest HR value. This will require some advanced knowledge about the Java Swing GUI elements.     Estimated 400 points

It takes a bit more thinking. but will result in a more robust piece of code. with more potential for reuse. and fewer opportunities to make errors.    The `Main.java` file is the primary location of this issue. with the following static functions      ```java      public static MainWindow getMainWindow()  	{  		return mainwindow;  	}  	  	public static StatReader getStatReader()  	{  		return statReader;  	}  	  	public static StatKeeper getStatKeeper()  	{  		return statKeeper;  	}  ```    The goal is to abstract the logic for each of these classes. so that you don't need to access the `statReader` or `statKeeper` via the Main class.

Since there are multiple "moving parts" in this project -- from the parsing of the data to calculating statistics and maintaining all the info for lots of players -- tests are helpful to make sure that when we add new functionality we don't break any existing code. Add JUnit tests for the following classes. testing all functions and corner cases.     * Player  * Split  * StatCalculator  * StatKeeper  * StatManager  * StatReader (This one handles the XML parsing. so you may need to also create some "test" XML files)  * Statistic  * XMLContentHandler    Estimated 300 pts

The classes that need more javadocs are:    * Player  * StatManager  * StatKeeper  * Statistic  * XMLContentHandler (if you have time.

One way to do this would be use java regular expressions (a quick tutorial can be found [here](http://www.vogella.com/articles/JavaRegularExpressions/article.html)). This way. by using pattern matching. you can filter the user's input and provide them with appropriate hints to guide him/her to the right solution. Make sure to have the hints visible at the same time as the problem statement so that the user can look at the hints whilst solving the problem.

The following improvements still need to be made:  * Implement "ghost text" (similar to how the username/password string disappears on elegant login promts) for each of the min/max fields for each character type.  * implement "ghost text" for the "leave blank for default set of characters" prompt. which would reaplce the "if unchecked..." message  * implement the field for user special characters to have listeners that change the includeUserSpecial boolean of the password object       * if the field is left empty. assume the user wants the default set of special characters       * if the field has new text entered in it. set those as the userSpecialChars string to draw the special characters from. (this function already exists. but is triggered by the generate button. and not the presence of text in the field for user special chars).       * if the field is changed back to empty. assume the user wants the default set. again.\  * if any of the min/max fields are filled in. **automatically check their associated text box**. if any of the min/max fields go back to containing an empty string. automatically uncheck them.  * set the text fields "uppercase". "lowercase" etc to be clickable regions that activate their checkboxes    here's a mockup of this more elegant interface with ghost text:  ![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/YM3Wn1M.jpg)

This is because:  * the junit package is only installed on CSIL machines. and is in pconrad's directory ```/cs/faculty/pconrad/public_html/cs56/lib/junit-4.8.2.jar```  * the ant file currently references pconrad's location for the junit package  * the PasswordTest.java file will not compile if not on CSIL because the JUnit package is missing!    So. I created the following fix (commit 262e95a on Vince's fork of the repo) to this problem that differentiates compiling into two options:   * a ```compile``` target that is default. and EXCLUDES **/*Test.java files from compiling (the **/ is a wildcard that tells ant to ignore any *Test.java files recursively aka in any subdirectory). This is the default compile target. and is depended upon by run. javadoc. etc.  * a ```compileForTest``` target that is depended on by ```test```; this INCLUDES any **/*Test.java files.     This workaround allow the project to _run_ anywhere outside of CSIL. but not _test_.    So. here are some suggested ways to make the project truly independent of CSIL:    * **Gracefully handle exceptions** create a block in the build.xml file that will check whether the current system has a junit package. Suggested value: **25 points**       * If the package exists. and is configured. run normally.        * If not. write a message to the command line prompting the user to install JUnit and configure the build.xml to route to THEIR junit location instead.      * expanding on the above functionality. **have ant run a routine that installs JUnit on the user's local machine. and configures the build.xml file to the according path**. Suggested value: **75 points**       * use Ant (or Java...or Maven!) to run a routine that would get and configure JUnit to the user's local machine. Note that this would probably require different routines depending on the user's operating system. In fact. Prof. Conrad mentioned this as one of the benefits to Maven vs Ant. so tackling converting this project into Maven from Ant would most likely also solve this problem. though would warrant a new. seperate issue. and more points than my estimate for only fixing THIS issue.       * soft-code the location of Junit so that it can instead be mapped to the user's install location if OR after JUnit is installed      Total estimated value: **100 points**

Our focus was not on issues that were already made. instead we fixed things we noticed needed to be implemented. There are issues (as follows) made by us for these fixes: #20 . #26 ; as well as #14 which is the only issue that we completed that was already identified by Professor Conrad.    One more thing. there seems to be something wrong with my (juliomaldonado) GitHub commit ID. It sometimes will post on my behalf but it changes the contributor name to "Julio Maldonado" and the account it links to seems to be a guest account. I am unsure why this occurs. however. I did all of those commits.    I made this pull request in addition to #21 which is for Lab06. although they contain the same material. just to be safe.

That is. it will create an ArrayList of cards consisting of ALL of the cards in ALL of the card sets--one giant cardset.  Call this one by the special name "ALL CARDS"  (in all caps.)      Don't allow "ALL CARDS"  to be a directory name under /cardsets---if it it occurs. just print a message on standard output that that directory is being ignored.   To test that. you'll have to create an "ALL CARDS" directory (with the space) under your testing directory.  Use a backslash to escape the space:    ```  mkdir ALL\ CARDS  ```    (2) Add support for leveling up to larger grids.    At the moment. the largest grid possible is 6x6.    Add support so that when leveling up. if there are sufficient images in the selected card set (e.g. ceiling (n*n/2)) that when leveling up. the next size grid up will be displayed.    In addition. add a "give up" button that allows a user to "end game" if he/she is fed up with the game. and wants to just end the game with the points already earned.    Note that they still get to keep all points earned up to that point---they aren't quitting the game--just ending it.    ~estimated 400

When starting up the game. look under /cardsets instead of under /images.    The only image that should be under /images is the "blank" image that is going to be used.    If no suitable cardsets are found. the program should not start. but should print an error message.   Otherwise. start by giving the user a GUI that shows a collection of images on a grid.  Each set must have at least 18 images. but it may have more. so the grid should be 6 wide. and 3 high. at least. but should allow for scroll bars in case the number of images cannot fit on the screen.    Each cardset should be displayed with the name of the card set at the top. and three buttons:  previous.select. next.  In addition. display the number of the card set. as in 1 of 3. 2 of 3. 3 of 3.   The cardsets should rotate... that is "prev" from 1 should be 3. and "next" from 3 should be 1.  Note that the numbers being displayed to the user are "off by one" from the indexes used in Java arrays and ArrayLists---because that's what normal humans expect (numbers starting at 1. not 0.)    The prev button goes to the previous cardset. while the next button goes to the next card set.    Once a card set is selected. it is used for the game.   If the card set has more than 18 cards. cards can be randomly selected from the card set.      To support this. add a constructor for MemoryCardSet that takes an existing MemoryCardSet instance and an integer "count"  as a parameter. and returns a new MemoryCardSet that contains only "count" cards. randomly selected from the original. and use that to implement the feature.  (This will come in handy for a later issue as well---when we allow the user to select "random mix across all card sets".)    Then. modify the game so that it proceeds as before. but using the selected card set.    If the game is "restarted". allow the user to go back to the card set selection menu and choose a different card set.    ~estimated 300

This can be done at first WITHOUT changing the existing game. but as a standalone piece of code.    To avoid merge conflicts with others working on the main code:    * Put all of the java classes for this issue into a separate subdirectory and package called:      edu.ucsb.cs56.projects.games.memorycard.cardsets    Copy  build.xml to a separate file called build2.xml and when you type ant. use:    ```  ant -f build2.xml compile   ant -f build2.xml run  ant -f build2.xml clean  etc.  ```  So that you don't have merge conflicts with build.xml.   Similarly. if you want to put anything into  README.md. instead of changing README.md. add a file README2.md that has your information in it.      = Background =    At the moment. the following lines have hard coded image file names:    ```    // The first 8 images.

"/images/205.jpg".  	"/images/206.jpg". "/images/207.jpg".      };      // The next ten images.

"/images/217.jpg".                };  ```    That means there is only one set of memory cards that can be used with the game.  That's dumb.    We should be able to play the game with any set of images that are of the correct size (pixel wise. width x height.)         It would be nice if we could bring up the game. and scroll through a gallery of images and select which ones we want to use---or have the computer randomly select images for us to use.    Some selections might be harder than others. and this could be incorporated into a "leveling up" mechanism later on.    This issue doesn't get all the way there.. instead it creates some classes that form the foundation of adding that at  a later stage.    = What we are doing instead of hard coding =    As an alternative. make a directory structure like this.  (For the time being. this can exist side by side with the existing code.)    ```  /cardsets  /cardsets/ragefaces  /cardsets/ragefaces/200.jpg  /cardsets/ragefaces/201.jpg  ...  /cardsets/flowers  /cardsets/flowers/daisy.jpg  /cardsets/flowers/petunia.jpg  ...  /cardsets/playingcards/  /cardsets/playingcards/AceSpades.jpg  /cardsets/playingcards/2Spades.jpg  ...  ```    The idea is that each of these directories will contain at least 18 images. all of the correct size (pixel wise.)    Any image that is not of the correct size will be ignored (and a warning message will be printed on standard output.)     Any subdirectory  that does not contain at least 18 images of the correct size will be ignored (and a message will be printed on standard output.)    Create a class called MemoryCardSet that extends ArrayList<String>.    Add an extra attribute String directory. and a getDirectory() method.     The constructor can take a directory such as "/cardsets/playingcards".   It will then use code like that found here:    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3923129/get-a-list-of-resources-from-classpath-directory    to traverse that directory.   Have a static method called "isSuitableImageFileForMemoryCard(String filename") that returns true if a file is an image file of the correct size to be a memory card. and returns false if it is NOT an image. or if is the wrong size.        Pass every element of the directory to that method. and print a message on standard output for each one that is NOT suitable.   For each one that IS suitable. add it to "this" (the ArrayList<String> being constructed).   If you don't reach at least 18 images before the directory is finished. throw an InsufficentImagesException from the constructor.  The code invoking the constructor shoudl catch that exception and print a message on standard output that that directory didn't have enough images in it.    The next level up in the code is a class MemoryCardSetCollection which extends ArrayList<MemoryCardSet>.     The constructor for this takes a directory. e.g. "/cardsets" and checking each directory under that.  trying to construct a MemoryCardSet for each one (e.g. one for /cardsets/ragefaces. one for /cardsets/flowers. one for /cardsets/playingcards. etc.)       Make JUnit tests for  both of these classes.     You can create a separate directory called "test_cardsets" that has under it various directories with different numbers of files. sizes of images. things that are NOT images. etc. to test that your methods work.   Check that the proper exceptions are thrown. etc.  Some of your directories should be legal cardsets. and others should NOT be legal cardsets.       This issue is ONLY for creating these classes and the JUnit tests to check for legal vs. non-legal cardsets.  Once that is done. the next step is to incorporate into the memory game.    ~estimated 300

Change the code so that the format of the high score file is very simple "comma separated values". i.e. a name followed by an integer number of points.    (2) To prevent problems. if there are any commas in the string that the user puts in as the name. simply remove them.     Add  a public static method called removeCommas that takes a string with one or more commas. and returns the same string with all commas removed.  Add JUnit tests for this method.  Use this method to implement the feature.    (3) The file HighScoreBoard.java has no javadoc comments. and no JUnit tests.  In fact. its really quite a mess.   Refactor the code into something that resembles reasonable quality.    (4) When you finish a game. the dialog boxes that come up are very confusing.   It is not at all clear what you should answer to the questions. and it is confusing that there are multiple dialog boxes coming up at the same time.   Clean up this code so that the user knows what to do.    ~estimated 300

It shows the Class names and the object names that were created for each class.  This allows the next programmers to easily understand how the classes are related.  The reason we created this was because we struggled ourselves going through the classes to find their relationships.

It would not save the points from the previous games but would set the names to null and the score to 0. It would also not put any score for the user that had just won.  It was all implemented in the same ActionListener. which was all in the same try statement. which was all nested in the same method.  We wrote it in an object oriented manner with low coupling and high cohesion.  We opened a new window after the game which asks for the winning user to implement their name.  It then will search the file to determine if it will make the high scores list that is saved.  Then it displays all the high scores in the correct order.  It also has a link back to the main menu to play again.

Give similar error feedback for numbers that are out of bounds for their respective encryption methods. For example. method one says "Numbers must be between 1 and 1000 inclusive".  but when I include a zero in the list. the result in the GUI just shows `0`. In the terminal window. there is output that says `Number Error; Integer x must follow: 1 <= x <= 1000`. but when running a GUI application you cannot assume that the user will see terminal output. The same thing happens for method 2 and method 3.    Fix all the methods so that correct error messages are displayed to the user within the GUI    ~estimated: 100

An obvious improvement is to factor out the "one per building methods" into a single "displayBuilding(String buildingCode)" method that would work off of a HashMap to get the correct information?    Similarly. it seems crazy to have a separate JLabel object reference for each building. rather than putting them into an ArrayList or HashMap. and then iterating through.    Try to get rid of everything that is iterating over building name---and replace it with appropriate data structures.

cs56-games-roguelike, W15-YES , dcoffill , dcwang (6pm) , ASCII roguelike game , 14 , Add Exploration  , HMCodingSnowMan , closed , rick-lee , One of the common features to dungeon crawlers is exploration. Right now the whole map is revealed at the very beginning however we want the player to "explore" the dungeon. This means the player should have to go around the dungeon at least once to see the entire map.     The player should only have vision of a few squares around him at the beginning then as he goes through the entire map the dungeon is revealed. (the revealed part does not turn black after it leaves the player's vision range.)     ~estimated 150

What should happen is that it should have a starting menu that says:    The title (Roguelike CS56 or give it a name)  Play  How to play  Exit    and anything else you can think of that would look nice in this gui.

The floor[][] array is an array of plain old Object.    That's not right.  It should be array of some kind of thing like Character---a thing that can be placed on the board.    That Character could be either a Player or a Monster.   And there are several kinds of Monster.    Should Character be an abstract class or an interface?    Should Monster be an abstract class or an interface?    What should inherit from what?   All of these questions deserve a second look. and then the code should be refactored accordingly.   There are entirely too many "typecasts" and "instanceof" operators at the moment.    ~estimate 200
cs56-games-roguelike, W15-YES , dcoffill , dcwang (6pm) , ASCII roguelike game , 5 , Fix the problems with the movable method in LogicEngine , pconrad , closed , HMCodingSnowMan , There are multiple problems with the "moveable" method in the LogicEngine class.    (1) It doesn't pass its unit tests.    (2) It is named incorrectly----at the moment. the name and the javadoc imply that it is just a simple test of whether a player can be moved to a particular position or not.    In fact. it is a function with significant SIDE EFFECTS!    (Those side effects would NOT be anticipated by anyone that reads the javadoc. or the name of the function.)  The side effects apparently are to initiate an attack. and/or to set the position of the player if it is a legal move.    Suggested fix:    Separate the function of testing whether a move is legal or not from the function of actually MAKING the move.    Let's look for all instances of calls to the movable method by doing:     grep moveable *.java     in the src directory.   We see that the only calls to the method are in RogueController.java    In moveHero. replace:    ```  public void moveHero(){  		if(!logicHandler.movable(x.y.origX. origY)){    				if(logicHandler.monsterIsDead(x.y)){  					canvas.clear(x.y);  				}    			x = origX;  			y = origY;		  		}  		canvas.moveHeroAnimated(x. y.logicHandler.getPlayer().getHitPoints());  	}    ```    with:    public void moveHero(){                  if ( logicHandler.movable(x.y.origX. origY) ) {                       logicalHandler.move(x.y.origX.origY);                  } else {                         // see if it is becase of a monster.  If so.                          // do whatever monster thing perhaps needed to happen                         // and was previously done inside the "check" movable...  			if(logicHandler.monsterIsDead(x.y)){  					canvas.clear(x.y);  			}                         //  The following lines are stupid... they are are lines where we "undo" the move                         // we made because it is illegal.   Shouldn't we instead see if the move is legal b  		// 	x = origX;  		//	y = origY;		  		}  		canvas.moveHeroAnimated(x. y.logicHandler.getPlayer().getHitPoints());  	}

cs56-games-Go, YES , alecharrell , pichumy , A gui version of the Chinese board game called Go , 5 , Fix GamePlay Bug , jstaahl , open , nickabrahan , As of right now. the game does not allow a user to ever place a piece inside of a space where they would have no liberties. This sounds correct. but actually. in the game Go. a user is allowed to place a piece in a space with no liberties if it will result in capturing some of the opponents pieces and after the removal of these pieces the placed piece has liberties (and as long as it does not violate the Ko rule).  Example:  ```  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  B  +  +  +  +  +  B  +  B  +  +  +  +  +  B  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  ```  A white piece could not be placed in the center of these 4 black pieces because it would have no liberties.    However. in the following configuration:  ```  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  B  W  W  +  +  +  B  +  B  B  W  +  +  +  B  W  W  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  ```  A white piece would be allowed to be placed in the middle of the black pieces because when placed there. white would surround and capture two of the black pieces resulting in:  ```  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  B  W  W  +  +  +  B  W  +  +  W  +  +  +  B  W  W  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  ```    Fix this gameplay bug. and also make sure the Ko rule is implemented.  (Search Go Ko rule)    In addition. become familiar with all of the rules and corner cases of Go and make sure these are all well implemented as well.    ~estimated 200

cs56-games-snake, W15-YES , alecharrell , eshong , Snake game , 19 , Improve the draw method of the snake , vinlara , open , This issue was found from fixing issue #18.    Issue #18 was caused because the draw method of the snake is not very consistent. To explain further. Everytime the snake leaves the game window. it is redrawn differently then the previous snake. The new snake is redrawn in a different coordiante plane then the first snake. This results in there being a varying amount of space between the snake and the game window  each time a new snake is drawn. When the snake is right next to edge of the game window. sometimes there is a small gap between the snake and the window and sometimes the snake overlaps with the window. This applies to all edges of the window.    To fix this. the programmer needs to figure out how the snake is redrawn each time it leaves the game window and make that method more consistent.

The bug is as follows. while playing the game if the player attempts to move the snake to the left or the right at the top of the screen. the snake will occasionally become stuck beneath the title bar.     In order to fix this bug. the programmer needs to figure out why the bounds of the frame overlap with the title bar.

cs56-games-snake, W15-YES , alecharrell , eshong , Snake game , 16 , Refactor SnakeFrame into multiple objects/files , bronhuston , open , vinlara , Currently. almost the entirety of the Snake game is made and controlled in the SnakeFrame.java file. The Gui. game controls. graphics. game logic and more are all in the same file.     The game should be refactored into multiple files for the different objects required for the game. There should be separate files to handle the JFrame/GUI. snake object. level generation. graphics. etc.     The code should be refactored and cleaned up before any additional functionality is added to the game.    ~estimated 400

Then update the README.md. giving a full and detailed description that will help any new programmers get jump started and be able to fully understand what's going on in the code.    Note: This issue should be completed first. as it will help you understand the program you are working with much better and will facilitate a more enjoyable experience for you when making changes and completing future issues.
cs56-music-basic-synthesis-demo, W-15 YES , mliou , mohithingorani"," wespollek (5pm), A basic demo of some simple synthesis starting with sine waves , 27 , Edit GUI to Allow Note Selection via Midi, Scientific Name, or Frequency , rtwaltman , open , Currently. when picking notes to play or build the melody with. the GUI only supports frequency. but not many people memorize frequency for pitch when we have midi and scientific name as well (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies for reference).    Edit the GUI to allow the user to select what he/she would like to build the note with: midi. scientific name. OR frequency. Here are a few way to accomplish this. but they may not necessarily be the best way:  * Edit the frequency text field and slider to represent any representation of pitch. allowing the user to select which form they want for the current note by selecting the option in a drop down menu (JComboBox - http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/combobox.html). When the form is selected. the text field and slider should now read out the current form. Note that the frequency map was written in a way where the frequency. scientific name. and midi can all be mixed and matched in the *same* melody.  * Alternatively. it may be a better idea to get rid of the text field and slider all together and simply allow the user to type in the pitch that they want for the given format. Instead of using a drop down menu (JComboBox). it may be a better idea to allow the user to simply type in what they want the pitch to be represented as. and then convert it as necessary using the frequency map in the code. In essence. the user should be able to type "261.626". "C4". or "M60" to represent 'middle c' and the code should automatically convert them. if necessary. to the correct frequency to be built with. See this chart for help converting to midi if unfamiliar (http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/600/numbersp.jpg).

We had the following behavior:  * If we add a single note to the melody and try to play it back. we get a very short. truncated note  * If we add a second note to the melody and then play it back. both the first note and second note would *then* play back correctly.  * If we add N >= 2 notes. playback works correctly for all notes    Now. after completing issues 18 and 19 (https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-music-basic-synthesis-demo/pull/23). we have a similar issue. When building a melody. we have the following problems:   * If we add a single note to the melody and try to play it back. we get no sound output  * If we add a second note to the melody and try to play it back. we get a short clip of sound. which is undiscernibly different in length from the *original* truncated sound we experienced above  * If we add a third note to the melody and then play it back. all three notes play correctly in order  * If we add N>=3 notes. playback works correctly for all notes    Investigate and fix this problem. providing a description of the cause of it in the pull request for the issue. as well as a description of the changes made to remedy it.

General usability and readability has been vastly improved. Descriptions have been added for all targets. Command line running for melodyGUI. single file melody. three file melody. full ADSR melody. and basicGUI has been implemented. Most targets have been rewritten for clarity. using Professor Conrad's build.xml files from labs as a reference. Javadoc URL had "13S" present in it. which I changed to "W14."    html subdirectory has been deleted.    README.md has been fullly updated to reflect changes to build.xml for command line running of various classpaths (-Darg). This includes multiple options for running different melodies.    As I have spent roughly 4 hours on this section alone. I have requested points to be 100. The build.xml needed many new options for different melodies to be run correctly. which required the implementation of -Darg. That took me awhile to learn. grasp. and play with so that everything worked correctly. The build.xml had LOTS of redundant property names and many non-working targets. As I had limited experience writing the build.xml files by hand. that took me quite some time as well. I also spent a significant amount of time trying to figure out why sound was throwing all kinds of errors before I started the README. That ended up being the result of putty. however. which was a relief. Editing the README took a significant amount of time as well. as I needed to play with the formatting quite a bit so that things were readable. This link ended up being useful: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting.     ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  --ISSUE 19--  ~requested: 250    Changed input handling to allow file formats that have midi values. scientific names. or frequencies given for pitch in the ```pitch duration volume``` format. We built a hashMap of the octaves 1-7. that's 84 available keys! Old formats for YellowSub.txt. MaryHadALittleLamb.txt. and Default.txt do not currently work as they are in the old incompatible format and need to be updated to use either midi. scientific name. or frequency for their pitch. As such. the README completed in Issue 18 needs to be rewritten.  Note: Scientific name works for both flat and sharp inputs. as they refer to the same key. Ex: "C#6" and "Db6" may both be used and they will both generate the same frequency. as they are technically the same key.     All frequencies are generated via the key number and the function on this page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies    Added a master volume control in both basicGUI and melodyGUI. The master volume control will adjust the volume of any saved notes through the melody GUI and then play them back accordingly when "play melody" is clicked. but does not currently work for playing single notes. as they are generated differently. Command line implementation of volume control is not fully implemented.    ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  --ISSUE SUGGESTION--  ~requested: 100    Note that we have suggested a viable issue for this project's command line options.

Add additive synthesis. where you can specify an ArrayList<Double> of amplitudes of the harmonics of the principle frequency. and use that to generate more complex waveforms.  For example. using 1/n amplitude for the odd harmonics approximates a square wave (1/3 of the 3rd harmonic. 1/5 of the fifth harmonic. 1/7 of the 7th harmonic. etc. with 0 for the even harmonics.).    A regular plain old sine wave is now the special case of a vector of length one with coefficient 1. (i.e. 1 times the fundamental frequency.)    Add this capability. and appropriate controls into all of the main programs (command line and GUI) in the project.    ~estimated 600

Melody files should be in the format:    <pitch> <duration> <volume>    Pitch should either be a frequency in Hertz. OR a note name from the "scientific name" column of the chart on this page. OR Midi value specified as M1 M2 M3. etc.    The code should check the format of the input string (perhaps against a regular expression?) to see which format is being used.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies    Use b for flat and # for sharp.    Note that these frequencies can be calculated with a formula involving the 2 to the 1/12 power---you do not need to hard code them.         Duration should be a fraction of a beat. and the "tempo" in beats per minute should be used to determine the length of a beat.    At 60 beats per minute. each beat is 1 second.  At 120 beats per minute. each beat is 1/2 second.      At 30 beats per minute. each beat is 2 seconds. etc.    Then for loudness. let the 1.0 be a relative scale where 1.0 is the maximum volume.     Multiply the envelope volumes by the note volume to get the actual volume used to play the note.        Add an additional control to both the command line and GUI programs which is an other "overall" volume scaling factor applied to EVERY volume. between 0 and 1.   REASON: to avoid clipping.    This allows you to specify notes of maximum volume as 1.0 rather than 0.95 or 0.99---and just put an "overall" volume scale of 0.95 or 0.99 that adjusts the volume of every note.    ~estimated: 300

Also. the only target that has a description on it is one that should be eliminated---the "linenumbers" target.    The html subdirectory should be gotten rid of---its from the old way of doing packages.       Make sure that the README and the build.xml have adequate documentation and appropriate targets to run ALL of the code.    Look at some other examples of projects that use -Darg logic to get  command line parameters from the user and pass them into the target inside the build.xml file. and modify the build.xml here apporpriately.

This note class is independent of what waveform (instrument) is used to play the note---its just an abstract "note".    A note with frequency 0 can be considered a "rest".    Implement constructors. getters and setters. toString and equals.   (Let frequency 0 indicate a rest. let duration be in "beats". where 1 is one beat. 1/2.0 is a half beat 1/4.0 is a quarter beat.etc.).  Volume is a double between 0 and 1 (1 is max.)       Throw IllegalArgumentExceptions for negative frequencies. negative beats. 0 length or negative length durations. and volume outside range of 0 to 1 inclusive.    Add NoteTest.java with JUnit tests including testing for exceptions for illegal argument values.    Then define a Melody class that extends ArrayList<Note>.    Then implement a "play" method that uses the ADSREnvelopedContinuousSound class to play the melody--modelled after the main method of ADSREnvelopedContinuousSound.     Make it a method that could be called from a main.     The parameters should be an envelope and a Melody.   Scale the envelope levels for each note by the volume level of that note.    Create a main that takes a simple hard-coded melody (hard coded as initializations into an ArrayList) and plays it as a demo.     The envelope could be hard coded too. or better yet. taken from command line parameters.   (There could be a default if no parameters are entered.) This is a first step towards a later issue where the melody is read into the ArrayList from a file. or created via a a GUI and stored in a binary file with Serialization.

Create a new mode where the player gets to control ghosts and eat the Pacman instead.  The could replace versus mode. or be a new mode entirely.    The pacman would need AI. which could be tricky.  You want the pacman to avoid the ghosts while still targeting remaining pellets.  (Target ghosts if powerups are implemented)    You should give the players a time limit to catch the pacman and if they don't. they lose.  (Need this otherwise the ghosts can camp some pellets and the pacman will never be able to eat them all)  If they catch him. they move on to the next level.  The more pellets that the pacman eats before they catch him. the less score they get.    2 ghosts would be best since 1 ghost would never catch pacman with good AI since he moves faster than ghosts.  With 2 ghosts. you can trap the pacman; 3 ghosts might be unfair with humans playing them.  (You can consider having a human control 1 ghost. and some AI controlling other one)  Doesn't necessarily need to be 2 players though. one player could play both ghosts though it might take some practice to coordinate.    ~500 points

Added command line arguments to set the file name of the serialized file. with the default value being "pacmanLeaderboard.ser." To implement the command line arguments we had to add targets to build.xml (use "ant run" to run without command line arguments and "ant run-args -Darg0=filename. where you specify filename).

Create a GamePlayed class that stores information about a Game Played (name. date/time. score) and then make a Leaderboard that extends ArrayList<GamePlayed>.      The ArrayList should be maintained in sorted order. by high score to low score.    (If you want to use a different data structure instead of ArrayList. that's fine.   Or you can figure out how to make ArrayList<GamePlayed> sort the way you want (see for example: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/890254/how-can-i-sort-this-arraylist-the-way-that-i-want ).    When someone completes a game. ask them for their name (like an arcade game) and store their score.    Then store in the leaderboard.    Then show the leaderboard with top 3 scores of all time. and the top three scores for that player. and write the leaderboard in serialized form to a file pacmanLeaderbaord.ser in the current directory.    If there is an error. catch the exception and display a warning: "COULD NOT SAVE LEADERBOARD" but the program should NOT crash.    On startup. try to read pacmanLeaderboard.ser from the current directory---if it doesnt exist. there should NOT be a program crash. just a warning: NO LEADERBOARD FOUND---CREATING NEW EMPTY LEADERBOARD."    Finally. add an optional command line parameter for an alternate filename for the leaderboard instead of pacmanLeaderbaord.ser in the current directory.    If args.length is zero. try to read/write from the default location otherwise if it is 1. use the args[0]. otherwise print a usage message.    Same as with the default location---only print warnings if the leaderboard can't be read or written. not fatal errors.    Keep the displaying of the leaderboard (the graphics part) and the maintaining of the leaderboard (updating. reading to file. writing to file) in SEPARATE CLASSES.  Try to write the leaderboard so that as much of the code as possible could be reused in another game.    Make sure there are JUnit tests for the plain old Java object classes (the ones with no graphics) and that there is javadoc throughout.

Add buttons to take over the role of the user's command-line input that when pressed update the ASCII visual.    The idea here is that when the user presses buttons to move a disk. the central textual component gets its contents re-written (or re-drawn) in place so that the disk appears to snap to the new tower. and although the towers are still drawn in ASCII. there is no scrolling text. or visible prior moves.    Include a component that is the live ticking timer (if implemented).    ~estimated 300

cs56-discretemath-towers-sierpinski, ? , jstaahl 4pm , ShadowAries , Java software to explore the relationship between the Towers of Hanoi and the Sierpinski Triangle , 35 , Pascal's Triangle Swing GUI , ShadowAries , closed , There are some interesting relationships between Pascal's Triangle. Sierpinski's Triangle. and the Tower of Hanoi.     For Pascal's Triangle. if every number were in a square and we were to shade in that square if the number were odd. we would observe a pattern that is the Sierpinski's Triangle.  See link:  https://www.zeuscat.com/andrew/chaos/pascal.sierpinski.clear.gif    Another relation in Pascal's Triangle is the sum of the terms in each row of the triangle.  Simply put: the sum of the numbers in the nth row minus 1 == the total number of moves required to move an ordered stack of nth discs from one column to another.   (Note: The starting row in Pascal's Triangle is the 0th row)  Example:  If we had 0 discs. we need 0 moves. ((1) - 1)  If we had 1 disc. we need 1 move. ((1+1) - 1)  If we had 2 discs. we need 3 moves. ((1+2+1) - 1)  If we had 3 discs. we need 7 moves. ((1+3+3+1) - 1)    Create a Swing GUI to observe this phenomenon.    ~estimated 250

There appears to be some slight typos with the name and associated colors. For example. choosing the "Winter" color theme appears to actually result in the Rainbow theme. The "Rainbow" color theme results in a red/orange/yellow theme which doesn't seem to be "Rainbow."     In addition to the issue above. add in 5 new. interesting color schemes.    ~estimated 100

I wanted to let you know that Issue #30 was completed but I was not able to complete Issue #31 or #32.   As shown in section. I was able to read in the "output.html" and store it in a string. However. what I found out was that the components I am using (JEditorPane or JTextPane) do not support the XML format. I did a web search and from what I understand I would need to use a third-party library in order to have the XML converted into something JEditorPane could handle. I've tried looking around for other solutions but was not able to find anything substantial. Perhaps there is a better and easier method to implement the GUI but I'm unable to see it. This is my first quarter in Java and to be honest I'm having a hard time understanding how everything works. Seeing how I was not able to complete the issues. I realize that I will not get the majority of points for project 1. I'm hoping that I do at least receive some credit for my time spent trying to set up the GUI. Please take a look at the "SierpinskiTriangleGUI.java" file to see where I was able to get to. Would 200 - 250 points be a reasonable request for everything I was able to accompish?     ~requested: 225

Create a swing GUI using some library for viewing HTML5 documents such as JavaFX which will display the xml file outputted by the program.  See: http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/swing/swing-fx-interoperability.htm    Your swing GUI should also include zoom buttons to allow the user to zoom as far in or out as they like (after all. we are working with Scalable Vector Graphics).    ~estimated 300

You will notice that there is a file named colors.properties in the root directory of the project.  If the hex color code values there are modified before the program is run with   ```  ant run  ```  then you will notice a change in the color scheme of the outputted SVG image.

The problem does not seem to get worse with more disks (the overlap past 3 disks remains constant).  Figure out a way to remove this overlap possibly by repositioning the render location of the towers.

Instead of adjusting the dimensions of the triangle   with the viewBox attribute for the main svg tag. save it as a symbol and set the viewBox of that instead.   This will allow one to further manipulate the triangle (add more content. shear. scale. etc.).   and prevent setting the viewBox of the entire svg document.

Do a mash up that allows you to see. for some GE area. which courses from that are are ACTUALLY BEING OFFERED in a particular quarter. e.g. S15.    Alternatively. do a mashup that allows you to see. for each GE on an area's list. a list of all quarters that course was offered (from among all the quarters currently available through the UCSB curriculum search page.)   This is helpful because the best 'predictor' of when a course will be offered (and indeed even whether it is EVER going to be offered again) is to see how often it was offered in the recent past. and which quarter(s) it was offered.    The next step would be to also indicate for each of those offerings what the enrollment is/was. and the total number of seats in the course. to see whether or not the course is/was/is likely to be full.

There are a few things that would make the code as cool as the idea is.  Take some time to improve on the GUI for the client to have a starting screen to select a server and port you wish to connect to.  This way the project is not reliant on CSIL and port 4242.    In the second GUI screen when interacting with the actual application there should be a menu drop down or a button somewhere to disconnect from the server which will lead them back to the initial screen so they can log in to a new server.    Remove the hardcoded server bindings (such as the port) and make it take parameters in from the command line to make the server application easier to deploy.    If possible split the client into smaller classes and add some Javadocs to them to make this code clean and perfect.    ~Estimated 300 points

Add a large textarea to the project. re-arrange the GUI. strip the buttons. and then make this application into a text searcher.  Split the massive text piece (could be thousands of words) into the text area. and then be able to search and autocomplete for words inside of the text you paste.    When you are searching for a word the text area field should jump to the first instance of that word found.  In addition there should be some navigating arrows next to the search box to go to the previous and next instances of the word found.

You may borrow from any code you find on the web. as long as you cite your sources.    If is ok. good even. to have multiple ways of doing it---though it might be nice to separate those into separate packages. e.g.    edu.ucsb.cs56.projects.tutorials.autocomplete.option1  edu.ucsb.cs56.projects.tutorials.autocomplete.option2  edu.ucsb.cs56.projects.tutorials.autocomplete.option3  etc.    and then have a description in the README of what the different options are.    That isn't required---if you have one option that works well. just go with that.    You should have a build.xml. and src directory and package just like every other project. (and good javadoc. etc.)

This is fine. but the JPanel is not made to match the JFrame size automatically.  As such. the screen can be resized and this causes the game to continue running when it should not.

cs56-games-country-runner, W15-YES , mliou , brianyan","salolivares (5pm) , Running game with obstacles. , 19 , Add sprite super class , thetomcraig , closed , We want to create a super class (sprite) that every on-screen character can inherit from.  This is because the runner and the obstacles will behave similarly. and we can reduce a lot of similar code.  This will involve refactoring most of the sheep class because it currently inherits from "obstacle" and should inherit from the sprite class instead.      The sprite class should include code to:  open and manipulate a sprite sheet   move the character onscreen  access the images opened from the sprite sheet  tell the sprite what image it should represent  various other tasks that involve mutation the sprite  maintain the "state" of the sprite for moving between animation sequences    Some of this code already exists but needs to be put in the correct class hierarchy so it can be abstracted and used by various kinds of sprites.    ~estimated 350 (discussed/posted in lab)    @andrewberls

cs56-games-country-runner, W15-YES , mliou , brianyan","salolivares (5pm) , Running game with obstacles. , 17 , Convert threading scheme to timing calculations , thetomcraig , closed , The JPanel currently has separate threads for separate actions occurring on screen. such as running. jumping. and obstacle movement.    While this works for animating the different images. I believe it would be more efficient and accurate to replace multithreading techniques with timing calculations.    This would involve calculating the current system time at various points in the execution of the main game loop. and giving each on screen object its own update time.  By comparing this update time with the current time. different images can be updated at different speeds and can appear to be moving more or less quickly relative to one another.  The implementation of this paradigm would also make it easy to add new elements to the game as they could subclass existing object classes. and would not need their own threads.    This would require refactoring a large part of the JPanel and as such we may not have time to do it before finishing work on the associated classes. like Runner.

cs56-games-country-runner, W15-YES , mliou , brianyan","salolivares (5pm) , Running game with obstacles. , 16 , Draw our own Pixel Sprites and assemble into a spritesheet , sdrhoads , open , Because we are implementing sprite sheets now. we will have to draw our own pixel sprites. (We are testing with random mismatching images right now)      Sprites should be contained within 100 X 100 pixels.     Sprites we intend to make include   Runner: poses for running  Runner: jumping (upward motion pose and falling pose)  Sheep Obstacle: Running poses  Scarecrow Obstacle: (He is stationary so no poses)    If time permits we can add:  Runner: Dying poses  Bird Obstacle: flying poses  New Obstacles    If even more time permits we can add:  Runner: Collision poses  Obstacle Collision poses   More New Obstacles     @andrewberls 
cs56-games-country-runner, W15-YES , mliou , brianyan","salolivares (5pm) , Running game with obstacles. , 15 , Add More Obstacles , sdrhoads , open , Create some different obstacles.  They can differ in size or speed so that the player has to vary his tactics.  This will make the game more interesting! Later. if we want to vary the game by time or levels. different obstacles can help us control how difficult the game is.    @andrewberls  ~estimated 150 
cs56-games-country-runner, W15-YES , mliou , brianyan","salolivares (5pm) , Running game with obstacles. , 14 , Implement Spritesheets , sdrhoads , closed , Use a sprite sheet for the runner and obstacles instead of drawing the figures in Java.  To implement this. we need to do the following:    1. Make spritesheets that contain all the images for each moving character/obstacle.    2. Create a Class that handles a specific animation sequence (running. jumping. dying. etc.).  This class will need to import a spritesheet for a character and extract sub-images from the sheet. and store them in an ArrayList.      In the Runner Class. for example. there will be several instances of SpriteSequence for each of his animation sequences.    When indexing through the images (in proper order). the runner will appear to be moving on the JPanel (we will use Translations too of course. but that is not implemented in the SpriteSequence class.)    @andrewberls  ~estimated 200 
cs56-games-country-runner, W15-YES , mliou , brianyan","salolivares (5pm) , Running game with obstacles. , 13 , Fix Collision Detection , sdrhoads , open , Current collision detection is kind of buggy.  It only check if the objects are at the exact same x and y position (so if the edge of the sprite clearly touches the obstacle. the game doesn't register it as a collision.)     We will need to know the size of each obstacle and the runner in order to have a more accurate collision detection.      @andrewberls  ~estimated 150 
cs56-games-country-runner, W15-YES , mliou , brianyan","salolivares (5pm) , Running game with obstacles. , 12 , Make a Title Screen  , sdrhoads , open , An opening screen that has (some) of the following options:     Play Game  Help (How to Play)  High Scores (Or list High Scores directly on Title Page)    Play Game is most important followed by the Help Screen.  High Scores cannot be implemented until a scoring system exists so it may be a issue for the future.     @andrewberls  ~estimated 200

The jump effect will have to be exaggerated (less gravity) so that he can jump high enough to avoid obstacles.     Note   Maybe make additional issue later to implement shorter and longer jumps based              on how long jump-key is pressed.     @andrewberls  ~estimated 150  
cs56-games-country-runner, W15-YES , mliou , brianyan","salolivares (5pm) , Running game with obstacles. , 10 , Add some information about the game to the README.md , pconrad , closed , Add a basic description of the "intended" final state of "version 1.0" of the game.    That is. if you got it to the 'simplest playable game' that you were satisfied with. what would game play consist of?  What would it look like?    Add a section to the README that explains that "intended version 1.0" of the game from (a) a player's point of view (b) a game developer's point of view.    What I mean by the distinction between (a) and (b) is that in (a) you would only write things that might be in the "help screen" if there were a help screen inside the game.  It would say things like "You control the runner.   press the blah key to make the runner jump.  you need to jump over the sheep."  stuff like that.      For (b) you might say things llike "we want the motion of the runner when jumping to actually model simple physics of jumping where there is acceleration of gravity making the jumper slow down as it goes up. and then acceerlate coming down.  You might say that you are assuming the runner is of height 2 meters (he's a tall runner) or 1.75 m or whatever. and since he/she is k pixels high. we are modelling 9.8 m^sec 2 as (fill in number here) pixels per second squared.   Except---we want gravity to work more like on the moon. so he can actually clear the sheep.  its a game. remember?       Then... maybe write somethign about what version 1.1 and 1.2 might have--- do you add levels?  What happens in later levels?  Is there keeping score?  Are there "lives"?  Is there a time limit?    That is. do some basic game design.  Just because you come up with the ideas doesn't mean you have to implement ALL of them this quarter.   But even coming up with a "road map" is worth some points.    ~estimated 50

cs56-utilities-todo, W15-YES , PazZaitGivon , hannavigil cpounds (4pm) , Multi-level todo list application , 15 , Fix bug with loading from a text file , pconrad , open , The GUI has a save feature that saves to a text file.    There is also a "load" feature. but that feature does not work.    Either fix this. or refactor the code so that the save/load feature works on serialized files (like the built in default save/load feature does.)    Depending on the approach taken. this may involve some parsing/regular expression work.  You will need to have some way to notify the user in a "nice" fashion if the text file you are trying to load has invalid syntax (e.g. if it was "saved" by the code. but then hand edited before being loaded back in. and the user that edited it by hand messed up the syntax.)

Improve the user experience by adding the ability to double-click and download or open an item depending on the item type. The MouseListener interface is able to interpret double-clicks. but since the table of items is a JTable. it implements a ListSelectionListener instead. which does not have this ability.

However. if a user wishes to return to a previous directory. the only way to do so would be to logout of the client and log back in. The changeDirectory method takes in a String. which is then passed to the "cd" method. Perhaps a button can be added to the GUI to that calls the changeDirectory method with a ".." parameter.

It would be cleaner and more user friendly if there was only one class with one main() that called the correct user interface class based on user selection.  Perhaps the user could specify with a command line argument whether they want that class to run the Swing GUI version or the command line version.  For example. `java FtpClient -gui` for the GUI or `java FtpClient` / `java FtpClient -secure` for the command line versions.  You would also need the modify the build.xml to reflect this new way of launching the application.    Estimated ~150 points.

Much of the code to change directories already seems to be in place. but it needs to be hooked up to the command line and graphical interfaces. and perhaps to the parsing engine (so that [user@]host[:port]/[path] would automatically display the specified path).  Perhaps double clicking on a directory. in the GUI. could switch into that directory.    ~estiamted 300

Issue 8:  We wrote all the game logic in model so that it can be taken to the next step and be implemented in the controller and the view/GUI. This includes a class for the FloodItGrid that contains a game board. We made a constructor which fills the board with random colors. The game board is a 2-d array that contains FloodItCells in the squares. We wrote a class for the cells. and each cell holds a color and index. We also created an array containing the current set of squares/cells "controlled" by the player. Using this. we made the main game logic that flood fills the grid. This means that a player selects a color and then all of his currently owned squares turn into that color and all the adjacent squares of that color join the list currently owned squares. Additionally. we made test classes to test various methods. This is especially useful now because we don't have a GUI to test the game.    ~Requested: 120 (for 7) and 350 for (8)

You might use a 2-d array. or an ArrayList of ArrayLists---up to you.        Using proper TDD (i.e. create the test first. and a stub that returns WRONG answers. or does NOTHING in the case of a setter). add methods to set the color of a square and get the color of a square.    Note that if you SET the color of a square. you need to "flood fill" all adjacent squares of the same color---and you may need to return an ArrayList of row.col pairs so that you can tell the GUI which cells need to be updated.       So you might want to create a new class that represents a Cell (with its row and col) and an CellVector extends ArrayList<Cell>.    When you are finished. you should have all the methods you'll need for representing the state of the game---and JUnit tests to make sure they all work.

You may keep the GUI the same. or refactor it as you see fit.    Note that this is also an opportunity to move from System.out.println() based communication with the user to communicating with the user through the GUI.    If you do the latter. add 100 to 200 more points to the issue. depending on the quality of the GUI designed.        The estimate below is based just on keeping the GUI the same with commuication with the user basically still happening through System.out.println statements.       The "controller" code should be the main that contains the JFrame. and it should ideally be the only code that knows about both the view and the model classes----otherwise. model classes should only reference other model classes. and view classes. only other view classes.    ~estimate 300

Perhaps the model is a SimonSaysGame object.    The constructor might initially create a sequence of one color in length.    It might then have a method getCurrentSequence that returns a sequence of colors (maybe as a string? maybe as an ArrayList of colors or letters or ints representing colors?)    Maybe then there is a method startTurn and a method guessNextColor that is called repeatedly. and returns either true if the color was guessed correctly. or false if the color was guessed incorrectly. and an endTurn method that might be invoked automatically after a timer expires to indicate the turn is over (if there is a time limit)      There might also be a method "getSequenceLength" that returns the length of the sequence currently being guessed. and a sequenceComplete() method that indicates if the user already guessed the entire sequence correctly and its time for a new set of guesses to start.    In short. come up with a model. and a set of unit tests that could be invoked on that model.         Put the code in this directory into one more package level down. namely:     src.edu.ucsb.cs56.projects.games.simon_says.view    then make a new class SimonSaysGame under     src.edu.ucsb.cs56.projects.games.simon_says.model    along with SimonSaysTest    and use TDD to make the tests pass.   For THIS issue to get full points. it is enough to have a plausible set of methods on the the SimonSaysGame object. along with unit tests that could be used to replace the game logic in the current SimonSays game code under view...but integrating that with the GUI is a separate issue.    ~estimated 300

(actually there is a bug that if you put the same type too many times it wont change ship types when you want it to) Keep track of which ships have already been placed and by the rules of battleship only allow those that havent been placed yet to be placed. Let the player know what they still have that they need to place(and once the game is in session those that they still need to sink). Also it would be helpful to tell the player how their ships will be placed when they click. that is. are they putting the leftmost point? The rightmost point? The topmost point? The bottommost point? Also make it clear to the player who's turn it is. the game is a little slow and its tricky to know when you can click and have an effect and when its processing your move.    Estimated ~400 points

More info on MVC can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller    There was another version of this project also https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-battleship-alt which shows some MVC usage of this project (it looks like that version is older and has less features).    When cleaning up the code please fix the packaging to edu.ucsb.cs56.projects.games.battleship    It also seems some of the features in this game are broken.  Such as allowing the same type of ship to be placed multiple times.  Rather than having a drop down menu it should cycle through the different ships.  There might be other issues as you work on this project.  Clean up as many of them as you can and ask for a re-evaluation if you find too many bugs to earn more points.    ~Estimated 500 points.

However. after coding for weeks into this project. we think it's necessary to do a code refactoring. The current project only has two classes with most of the functionality existing in TheGUI.java. As of now the code has low readability and can be a bit confusing.  Refactor the code and divide it to have more classes as needed.

We also changed the build.xml file. so that the program and the test program can run simultaneously.    Requested: 250 points    Issue #5 solved:  We did the code refactory mainly by adding three new constructors: the first one will set the HFH.jpg as the default image. the second one  will take a string variable as a parameter. thus we can load other pictures by names. and the third one takes two parameter(the name of the image and its path). So the program can load other images in the "images" folder. but we set the HFH.jpg as the default image that will be load as we run the program.    Requested: 150 points    Issue #6 solved:  Added new feature: Gallery.  We put another panel on the right part of the frame. and that panel contains a preview window. three new buttons: previous. next. and load. User can first preview other pictures in the "images" folder and then load the picture they want to view in detail.    Requested: 450 points           We thought the gallery would be better if we design a preview window. which will make it easier for users to find the very image they want to view in detail. So this is something beyond the issue originally requested us to do. therefore we request more points.    Another thing about the code:   During the refactory. we found that this code from the previous authors has a potential problem: It has all the methods in one class. so it was messy and complicate during our development. and it actually cost a huge amount of time to refactor. So. please view the source code "TheGUIs.java" and consider setting up a new issue about a complete refactory. and the purpose is to have a better style of coding and the for the feasibility of the future development.

However. we may encounter the need to use *.png images. or *.gif images. or *.svg images. etc. There are probably already classes in the java language to handle these possibilities. so do some research and find out what image file types are supported. If you also go ahead and refactor the code to work with multiple image types. that is great. and will earn you more points. If you only perform the research. you must add a page to this repository's [wiki](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-tutorials-image-zoom/wiki) with your results. Then future issues could be created to add support for those file types.     Estimated points  * Research only. with wiki page write-up: 50 pts  * Research. and then implement functionality for other file types: *variable* (you will work with your moderator and depending on the amount of work that was required. determine the appropriate amount of points)

It may be a subjective opinion. but it feels like increasing the width and height values by factors of their original values is too big of a jump for each click of the zoom button.     Adjust this function so that clicking the "zoom in" button displays a version of the image that is only 1.5 times the original size. for example. Then subsequent presses will increase by 50% (1.e. 2.0x. 2.5x. 3.0x...)    Estimated 100 pts

Since there are many images in the `images/` folder. or if the user wanted to specify one of their own. it would be nice to be able to choose or switch to another image. The exact details of this implementation are left to the developer    Some options are   * (best) Make a "gallery" view. where there is a "previous" and "next" button. and the user can scroll through all the pictures in the `images/` folder. Since this is a "tutorial" project. we want to show the capabilities of zooming on images. so you can include other non-map images as well. Maybe some higher-resolution images would show-off the level of detail that can be seen when you view in. (the last part is just a suggestion)  * (good) Allow users to "load" in an image from somewhere on their computer. This will require a prompt to open and select a file  * (acceptable) Allow for the user to specify another file they would like to view via the command line.     Estimated points:  * Gallery - 300 pts  * Load - 200 pts  * Command line - 100 pts

It is fine to use this image as the sample image; however. the references to HFH in the variable and/or function names is not good coding practice. Clean up the code and write it in such a way that it is clear what the functionality is regardless of what image is used.     Estimated 100 pts

Since this project is mostly comprised of GUI elements. and there aren't any basic Java classes. you will have to learn how to write some basic JUnit tests for GUIs.

The limits then disabled the buttons preventing further zooming. Making this limit functionality act perfectly took much longer time than the initial zooming implementation.    Issue #2 (pan):            Suggested point value - 150            Requested point value - 300  We ended up spending a lot more time on the panning function than expected from the suggested point value. A good proportion of our hours spent on the panning functionality was spent fixing the image that would always be loaded as black as well as getting the image to draw as well as fixing a large problem where zooming and panning wouldn't work together. For example. zooming in wouldn't allow panning vise versa. Carina noticed it was significantly harder than expected and helped us a lot. We are confident she'll agree that we deserve more points that the suggested amount.    We did not include proper coordinates/limits to how far you can pan or Where the zoom in would zoom after you panned to certain spot. so we included instructions on using the pan function.
