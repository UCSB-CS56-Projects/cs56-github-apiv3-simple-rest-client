a) This is a project in which we curate github information about multiple repositories into one location. We will be creating tools using the Github API to make this process of information-gathering more efficient.

b) The software in its current state cannot do anything since it has just been refactored. 

c) The software compiles in its current state but it is missing files. Some tests in the build.xml do not sucessfully run. We could not find certain files needed to fully build.

d) We need to add the token subdirectory containing OAuth tokens. We need to add more tests with updated links.  

e) The README.md does not fully explain the purpose of this project. This is probably the case since it has been refactored recently. As a result, there are not many commits yet.

f) There are many targets that need more descriptions. There are links that don't work anymore. For example, the targets are still under CS32. This needs to be changed to CS56.

g) There are enough issues right now to work on, but not enough points. The issues have a clear objective. A few more issues might be added later on.

h) We haven't added any issues yet. But we have thought about more tools we can use to interact with the spreadsheet.

i) The purpose of the code will be more clear once we delete old outdated code. We will be deleting some old files, and adding a new src file to refactor the old repository. The classes are not commented well, so we aren't exactly sure what they do yet. However, they are named so that we can identify them right now. The information we would convey to a programmer looking to get up to speed is that most of the repo is outdated and in some cases not needed. We will be adding an entire repo curation file that is the heart of our project. Also, the build.xml is outdated too. New tests will be added once the specific tools are outlined. 


j)There are no Junit tests yet. There is only a demo so far for the old project, which is different than what we are making. This is an area we can improve. Once we create the tools, the appropriate tests will be made.
