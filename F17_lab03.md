a) This is a project in which we curate github information about multiple repositories into one location. We will be creating tools using the Github API to make this process of information-gathering more efficient and automatic.

b) The software in its current state cannot do anything since it has just been refactored. As a user of the program I can run a few of the build.xml tests succesfully but without any useful results. Because the project used to by focused in a somewhat different direction, many of the tests are not relevant anymore. However, all tests do compile without error. 

c) The software compiles in its current state but it is missing files. Some tests in the build.xml do not sucessfully run. We could not find certain files needed to fully build, including an OAuth file that the program tells us needs to be added. There are also some outdated links that some of the tests look for that are no longer live.

d) We need to add the token subdirectory containing OAuth tokens. We need to add more tests with updated links. We need to add clearer documentation and tests to make it clear to the user what our program does and how to use it, because in the current state it is not clear. Finally, a clean way to output the data that the program finds into a spreadsheet is needed for our program to actually be useful to the instructors or ta's of this course.

e) The README.md does not fully explain the purpose of this project. This is probably the case since it has been refactored recently. As a result, there are not many commits yet with a README that does not correctly or clearly define the purpose of the project. The README.md file is definitely something that we will need to edit and re edit as we go further with the project.

f) There are many targets that need more descriptions. There are links that don't work anymore. For example, the targets are still under CS32. This needs to be changed to CS56. We aren't sure what many of the targets are meant to test or what they mean, and we suspect many of them are outdated for what we will be trying to do.

g) There are enough issues right now to work on, but not enough points. The issues have a clear objective. A few more issues might be added later on, as we checked with our mentor on the state of the issues so far. We do have enough to work on for the time being.

h) We haven't added any issues yet. But we have thought about more tools we can use to interact with the spreadsheet. That, however, is something that will come after we have working github API code that can get data from many repo's.

i) The purpose of the code will be more clear once we delete old outdated code. We will be deleting some old files, and adding a new src file to refactor the old repository. The classes are not commented well, so we aren't exactly sure what they do yet. However, they are named so that we can identify them right now. The information we would convey to a programmer looking to get up to speed is that most of the repo is outdated and in some cases not needed. We will be adding an entire repo curation file that is the heart of our project. Also, the build.xml is outdated too. New tests will be added once the specific tools are outlined. However, in the src file,many of the .java files do have somewhat descriptive names that would allow us to build onto them. For example, there is a "PullRequestGetterThingy.java" class that says it is meant to "work towards getting pull requests. Only partially working." There is a GithubAPIhelpers.java class as well and a userInfo class that seems to find and store links and info about the current user whose repo is being looked at. These parts of the project will be useful and will be added onto. The lack of comments leads us to only understand what we can from the class names, so after closer examination of individual lines of code and after learning the github API we will be able to understand more about the pre-existing aspects of our project. 


j)There are no Junit tests yet. There is only a demo so far for the old project, which is different than what we are making. This is an area we can improve. Once we create the tools, the appropriate tests can be made. More test programs in the build.xml with clearer descriptions and which use the new src files we create will make the end goal of our project much clearer.
