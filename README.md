Github Repo Curation

* Use kohsuke API to put together a database of cs56 student's github repo's


What's working now:
* Able to list the names of all private in the yossiyossi github account
* To run this, type "gradle run"
* Moved from ant to gradle
* Got kohsuke api working to grab the info about yossiyossi
* Need to include package name in all files (caused annoying error for a while)

ToDo:
* Get all of ucsb cs56 repos names, issue counts, and date of last commit.
